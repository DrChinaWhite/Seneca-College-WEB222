            Not all red foxes are in-fact red, there are many colour variations including brown,
            black and silver. With the latter being colloquially known as "silver foxes."
          </aside>
          <p>
            Red foxes are small, canine creatures that have pointy features and a slender body.
            Northern foxes fur is dense and fluffy and features silky guard hairs. Whereas their
            southern counterparts fur is sparser and coarser. Their fur is typically reddish-brown;
            however, their ears and legs are black. A distinguishing feature of the red fox is its
            white-tipped tail.

              Contrary to popular belief led by the artist Ylvis in 2013 foxes do not communicate
              through these phrases:

          <p>Rather foxes tend to communicate through body language, vocalizations, and scent.</p>
          <h3>Body Language</h3>
          <aside>
            <img
              src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487241281672-301e0f542588?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80"
              alt="2 Red Foxes Fighting"
              width="240"
              height="160"
            />
          </aside>
          <p>
            Foxes body language can be separated into two categories dominance and submissive. The
            body language consists of movements of the ears, tail, and postures. The line between
            aggressive and playful is not a straightforward task to determine by humans. One key
            indication is to look at the tail, if it is forming an 'upside-down U-shape' it could
            indicate play.
          </p>
          <h3>Vocalizations</h3>
          <p>
            Red Foxes have a large vocal range spanning five octaves. Using their vocal cords they
            are able to make a variety of different sounds including barks, screams, howls, squeals,
            and 'gekkering'. These vocalizations can be further categorized into contact calls and
            interaction calls. Contact calls are three to five syllable barking of
            <em>"wow wow wow"</em> often when two foxes are approaching one another. Interaction
            calls are usually high pitched whines which signifies submissiveness.
          </p>
          <h3>Scent</h3>
          <aside>
            <img
              src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540153448870-af780343526e?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80"
              alt="Red Fox Following Scent"
              width="240"
              height="160"
            />
          </aside>
          <p>
            Red foxes have a strong sense of smell allowing them to communicate through scent. They
            use chemicals from their urine and scents from their glands to mark their territories,
            and food storages. When two foxes meet, they will often smell each other's glands and
            urinate on each other to mark themselves as friends, or partners.

        <section id="Diet">
          <h2>Diet</h2>
          <p>Red foxes are omnivorous creatures and have a highly varied diet including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>voles</li>
            <li>mice</li>
            <li>raspberries</li>
            <li>insects</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Primary prey include small rodents, secondary prey include birds and insects, and
            occasionally they consume fruits. Red foxes prefer to hunt in the early morning hours or
            late evening. As red foxes are extremely possessive of their food they will typically
            forage alone; however, in areas with plenty of resources they may group together to
            share the bounty. They are very versatile and adaptable to their surroundings, as such
            are capable of hunting and foraging during the winter months.
